# Overview

This is a basic calculator written in Erlang. It also has a factorial feature that uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a number. As a software engineer I am trying to learn new skills, languages, and expand my knowledge. My purpose for writing this was to learn the syntax of Erlang and write some simple beginner code. This program implements basic functions and recursion in Erlang.
